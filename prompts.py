The features of a given tabular dataset are provided in the following delimited by triple backticks. \
Your task is to generate a detailed text description, in 1000 characters, that focus on features that are \
important for visualization type selection and \
comprehensively analyzes this tabuar dataset based on its feature values from both single-column and cross-column perspectives. \
Note that the response must exclude words such as line chart, scatter plot, bar chart, and box plot, since \
these words will mislead further visualization recommendation. \
The response format can be as "Single-column perspective: [...]. \n\nCross-column perspective: [...]."
Ensure that the summary maintains strong generalization ability and includes all vital information.

types to represent tabular data using line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots. \
Based on your knowledge of data visualization and the given rules and features of the data, \
recommend the best visualization labels that effectively communicate the data insights to the \
